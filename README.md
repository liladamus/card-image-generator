# card-generator

`card-generator` is a simple terminal-based utility to generate and display card images based on user input. It leverages the power of Node.js to fetch and display images directly in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

To install `card-generator` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g card-generator
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the command from anywhere in your terminal:

```bash
card-generator
```

You'll be prompted to enter cards in a comma-separated format (e.g., "4D,JC,9D").

For example:
```
Enter cards (comma-separated, like "4D,JC,9D"): 4D,JC
```

The corresponding card images will then be displayed directly in your terminal.

## Features

- Supports all standard playing cards (A, 2-10, J, Q, K in suits S, H, D, C).
- Displays card images directly in the terminal.
- User-friendly interface with command-line prompts.
